                    <h2>1. Check Your Credit Score Early</h2>
                    <p>Your credit score is the single most important factor in determining your mortgage interest rate. Even a 50-point difference can save you tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a 30-year loan.</p>
                    <p>Start monitoring your score at least 6-12 months before you plan to buy. Avoid opening new credit cards or taking out large auto loans during this period.</p>

                <div class="info-card" style="--card-color: var(--color-green)">
                    <h2>2. Save for More Than the Down Payment</h2>
                    <p>Many buyers focus solely on the 3%, 5%, or 20% down payment. However, "closing costs" usually range from 2% to 5% of the home's purchase price. This covers inspections, appraisals, title insurance, and taxes.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, you should keep an "Emergency Maintenance Fund" ready. Unlike renting, when the water heater breaks in your own home, the bill is yours to pay.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card" style="--card-color: var(--color-pink)">
                    <h2>3. Get Pre-Approved, Not Just Pre-Qualified</h2>
                    <p>In a competitive market, a pre-approval letter is your ticket to being taken seriously by sellers. While pre-qualification is a basic estimate, pre-approval involves a lender verifying your income, taxes, and assets.</p>
                    <p>This gives you a concrete budget, so you don't fall in love with a house you literally cannot afford to buy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card" style="--card-color: var(--color-purple)">
                    <h2>4. Consider the "Total Monthly Cost"</h2>
                    <p>Your mortgage principal and interest are only part of the story. When calculating affordability, always include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Property Taxes:</strong> These vary wildly by neighborhood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Homeowners Insurance:</strong> Essential for protecting your investment.</li>
                        <li><strong>HOA Fees:</strong> If the home is in a managed community.</li>
                        <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Houses are often more expensive to heat and cool than apartments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="info-card" style="--card-color: var(--color-blue)">
                    <h2>5. Think About Resale Value</h2>
                    <p>Even though you're just moving in, you should think about moving out. Is the home in a good school district? Is it near public transit? These "externalities" ensure that your investment grows in value, making it easier to sell or upgrade in the future.</p>
